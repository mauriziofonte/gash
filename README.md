## Quickstart üåü

Get Gash up and running in **under 60 seconds**:

### Install with cURL

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mauriziofonte/gash/refs/heads/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Install with Wget

```sh
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mauriziofonte/gash/refs/heads/main/install.sh | bash
